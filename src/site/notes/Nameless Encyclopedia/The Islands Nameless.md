# The Islands
The archipelago part of the Ke’ath Empire is commonly referred to as “the Islands.” These islands have been forcibly specialized and trading between islands is very important. 

### Alluring Island
**Leader**: [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/Zephanoth Nameless\|Zephanoth]]

A cursed island that specializes in fishing. All travelers who visit this island are lured to the center of the island by a magical force, where they are never seen again.
This curse, unbeknownst to all but [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/The Nameless\|The Nameless]], was cast by [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/The Hooded Nameless\|The Hooded]]. At the center of the island, there were 3 witches, promptly killed by [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/Sephai\|Sephai]] and the Nameless, thus lifting the island of its curse. Later, during their escape, the Nameless kills Zephanoth. 

### Stone Isle
**Leader**: [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/Feradonus Nameless\|Feradonus]]

A small island specialized in farming where the rat plague first attacked. Home to the Whistling Wolf tavern, named after the creaking of the door, which sounds like a wolf whistle. 

### Tropical Island
**Leader**: N/A

A tropical island where [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/The Nameless\|The Nameless]] and [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/Sephai\|Sephai]] washed up after the plane in the shipwreck incident. There is a tower on this island that is home to [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/Steve Nameless\|Steve]]. It was abandoned when Steve arrived, but it is now filled with Steve’s inventions. There is a temple underwater that was filled with [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath Monsters of the World Nameless#Sahuagin\|Sahuagins]] and which collapsed after a priestess unleashed a powerful attack within. The temple was ornate in design, with pillars holding up the cavern. There was an altar room.
