   TLDR: Time loops 2 and 3 happen here. In time loop 2, Kartoshka fireballs the guillotine and discovers the other slices of Timberfall. In time loop 3, Kartoshka and Silvanus completely ignore the impending death of Nessa and explore the rest of Timberfall. Time loop 3 has not ended yet.
2. [[Ke'ath Campaign Session Notes/02 - 08.20.2023 - Timberfall 3 The Pipeline\|02 - 08.20.2023 - Timberfall 3 The Pipeline]]
   TLDR: Time loop 3 happens, we keep exploring, my character runs into the tree and starts a massive fight with The Mage and The Tree. We learn more about how the Tree came to be and supposedly, why it's doing what it is. 
3. [[Ke'ath Campaign Session Notes/03 - 09.12.2023 - Timberfall 4 The Plan\|03 - 09.12.2023 - Timberfall 4 The Plan]]
   TLDR: Time loop 4 happens, we figure out what's going on and we confront the Mage about it and then we somehow come up with a plan to try to save everyone and release everyone from the time loop
