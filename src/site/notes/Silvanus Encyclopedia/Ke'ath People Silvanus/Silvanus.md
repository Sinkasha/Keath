# Silvanus
*Banished God of the Forest*

Silvanus was the great god of the forest, an adamant defender of mortals. He often overstepped his boundaries to help out, always claiming it was for the greater good. However, he went too far in the incident at Silva. With his rash actions, despite being for the greater good, he opposed the flow of fate. Thus, he was banished to the Astral Plane, forgotten by the world. 

While wandering the Astral Plane, he possesses the body of an unknown wood elf.
