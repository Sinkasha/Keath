# Ke'ath Mainland
**The mainland, home to Katal (the elven word for capital), the capital of Ke’ath. On its southern side is the sea.**

## Katal
### Alchemist's Guild
**Many an incident has occurred here.**
A building with an unreasonable and preposterous amount of chimneys, each with a different color and consistency smoke coming out. Parts of the roof are charred and patched over. Inside, alchemists use their plentiful funding to test and create new potions. 20 years ago, this building blew up. Now, every couple months or so, there’s a minor accident - a small explosion.

### Briesville
**A Memorium-radiated city**

An abandoned city, related to [[Silvanus Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Silvanus/картошка\|картошка]] and [[Silvanus Encyclopedia/Miscellaneous Silvanus#Static\|Static]], encountered an incident within the mines of [[Silvanus Encyclopedia/Ke'ath Mainland Silvanus#Ke'ath Mining Co.\|Ke'ath Mining Co.]] in the city. It is unknown what happened except that there are black spikes that appear to have exploded from within the mine above the land near the center of the city.

It is found that the city had been harnessing [[Silvanus Encyclopedia/Miscellaneous Silvanus#Memorium\|Memorium]] which has caused the downfall of Briesville. Notes in [[Ke'ath Campaign Session Notes/Silvanus Session Notes#Briesville\|Silvanus Session Notes#Briesville]]. The city has since been flattened from a Memorium explosion caused by [[Silvanus Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Silvanus/Xoisa Silvanus\|Xoisa]], [[Silvanus Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Silvanus/Silvanus\|Silvanus]], and [[Silvanus Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Silvanus/картошка\|картошка]]. 

### City Guard Building
**Home to the dumb and the nimble.**

A 3 story tall building, lines painted on the roof looking like a training floor, with a hatch in the middle. 

### Clocktower
**Loud and imposing.**

A clock tower that strikes the time every 15 minutes. It is quite loud beneath this tower.

### Ke'ath Mining Co.
**Rich**

A rich mining company. It was harnessing too much energy from [[Silvanus Encyclopedia/Ke'ath Mainland Silvanus#Briesville\|Briesville]]. Little else is known about this company. 

### Silva
**A forgotten village in the Silver Forest**

A village in the Silver Forest that has been forgotten after being demolished by gelatinous cubes. The reason for [[Silvanus Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Silvanus/Silvanus\|Silvanus]]'s banishment. The words "Silver Forest" cause [[Silvanus Encyclopedia/Miscellaneous Silvanus#Static\|Static]]. 

### The Institute
**Ke’ath’s best research university**

This is the best research university in Ke’ath, with the most recent research being conducted here. The building is quite brutalist, almost dreary. The computations department can be found here. 

### Timberfall
**A Floating Town with a Big Tree**

[[Silvanus Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Silvanus/картошка\|картошка]] and [[Silvanus Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Silvanus/Silvanus\|Silvanus]] come here looking for [[Silvanus Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Silvanus/Nessa Silvanus\|Nessa]]. The town of Timberfall is arranged like slices of a pie, with 12 slices and a very large tree in the middle and the roots splitting the circle into slices. On the very big tree in the center there are 4 clocks facing each direction. On top of the roots are walls, dividing each slice. The doorways between slices are heavily guarded. In the middle surrounding the tree is a heavily guarded center. On top of the roots are walls. See the map for visualization.

After [[Ke'ath Campaign Session Notes/01 - 07.30.2023 - Timberfall 2 Electric Boogaloo\|01 - 07.30.2023 - Timberfall 2 Electric Boogaloo]]

Every person who lives in Timberfall wears a rose lapel. When they die, they give off a flash of light and red lightning goes from their point of death towards the tree, which pulsates when it enters the tree. 

### Wynather’s Magical Emporium
**The finest craftsmanship in Ke’ath for six generations.**

A 1-story store, run by the Wynather family, with the front run by [[Silvanus Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Silvanus/Alta Wynather Silvanus\|Alta Wynather]]. This store sells magical items made by the Wynather family, a family of artificers.
