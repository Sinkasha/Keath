The Astral [[Silvanus Encyclopedia/Miscellaneous Silvanus#Planes of Existence\|Plane]] is inhabited by a race known as the [[Silvanus Encyclopedia/Ke'ath Monsters of the World Silvanus#Githyanki\|Githyanki]], a race of humanoids who travel using the Astral Sea. Many centuries ago, they were enslaved by mind flayers. 

The astral plane seems like a dangerous and frightening place. It is a graveyard for all things forgotten and dead. When something is forgotten by everyone and everything, the astral plane is its final resting place. 

The atmosphere is denser.
