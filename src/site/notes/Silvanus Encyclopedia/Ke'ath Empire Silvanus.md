The Ke’ath Empire is a large colonizing empire which has been ruled by King Herberos for over 400 years. King Herberos was assassinated recently, putting Katal on lockdown. It is mostly inhabited by humans and elves, creating tension as there are more humans but the elves have occupied the land for a far longer time. The King rules along with his many advisors, and gubernators (goobers) for each of the empire’s colonies. 

Majority of its inhabitants worship gods of [[Silvanus Encyclopedia/Ke'ath Religions of the World Silvanus#The Greek Pantheon\|the Greek Pantheon]], however, there is no national religion as King Herberos takes a laissez-faire approach to the topic. Although non-Olympian gods are legal to worship, they are considered taboo and people tend to do so in secret.

The slave trade and criminal organizations run rampant in the empire. However, there is no official police force to protect the people. Major cities have volunteer forces known as the “City Watch,” navy blue in color, colloquially known as the “Night Watch” at night, and collectively termed as “the Watch.” Should things get out of control, the military steps in.

The previous king, King Keranos, spent much of his reign in one war or another, building up the Ke'ath Empire. Now, [[Silvanus Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Silvanus/King Herberos Silvanus\|King Herberos]] can rule fairly peacefully, only occasionally preventing unrest.
