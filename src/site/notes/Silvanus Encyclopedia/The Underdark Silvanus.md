**Symbol**: 

Thousands of years ago, there was a near-apocalyptic war between the dark elves and the normal elves. The dark elves were banished into the underdark. The Underdark is now an area underground, dark and filled with monsters. The dark elves themselves have become evil, resenting regular elves. Surface-dwellers think the Drow are insane, as their actions are conventionally evil. 

Millennia of living in the Underdark, resenting those who have forsaken them, have made the dark elves harbor intense hatred for the surface-dwellers. Those who make it to the overworld are outcasts or mercenaries, hated by virtually everyone on the Material Plane. Many of these outcasts or mercenaries are driven mad.
