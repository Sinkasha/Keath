# Miscellaneous
### Artificers

This group of people is rare and recently developed. Few people have enough magical talent to be an artificer. 

### Computations Radar

A small mechanical bird in a cage, which chirps faster when closer to whomever they’re tracking. Stops chirping when their target is dead. Can be influenced by magic. Strong necrotic magic appears to make it glitch out(?). 

### Dark Items

They exist. Wow.

### Dragonborns

Skin color represents the element that a dragonborn has resistance to and can breathe.

### Harvest Festival

There are 2 moons, one larger and one smaller, that rotate around the sky in different phases. At a certain point in the year, the larger moon catches up to the smaller moon. In local mythology, this is seen as a wolf (the large moon) catching a stag (the smaller moon) and eating it. When this time arrives, the people know that the crops are ready to be harvested. It is during this time that the Harvest Festival is held. 

### Magic

The highest magical spell that a pure mortal has ever cast is 9th level. There are legends of spellcasters who surpassed that, but it is unverified. 

Items with spells imbued in them exist, however it is not possible to just “give” magic. These objects are hard to obtain, and usually only general objects are available, particularly for non-magic individuals.

There are items that can take energy from the people they kill.

### Wild Magic‎

Wild magic is a most chaotic form of magic. Wild magic sorcerers have almost no control over their magic, and whatever they cast is random, like the roll of a dice.

### Memorium

The most dangerous element [[Silvanus Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Silvanus/Andrea Silvanus\|Andrea]] knows of. Memorium consumes and radiates knowledge, in memories and history. Its power can be harnessed for use, yet causes strange side effects. It is very explosive when destroyed, causing visions. The boulder in [[Silvanus Encyclopedia/Ke'ath Mainland Silvanus#Briesville\|Briesville]] is Memorium, one that is centuries old. Briesville attempted to warn others of its danger but failed to account for the Memorium consuming the memory of it being dangerous. 

### Planes of Existence

The material plane or physical plane is the plane of reality in which most events seem to occur.

The astral plane seems like a dangerous and frightening place. It is a graveyard for all things forgotten and dead. When something is forgotten by everyone and everything, the astral plane is its final resting place. 

The ethereal plane exists.

### Static

When saying information connected to the missing towns/villages, the majority of the population hears a strange static. Trying to be clever and getting them to say it or understand it in a roundabout way makes them effectively zone out, and almost forget what happened. Those who can speak Static typically can understand Static. Very strange. Cause unknown. 

[[Silvanus Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Silvanus/картошка\|Картошка]]’s theory is that people hear Static because they have forgotten.
