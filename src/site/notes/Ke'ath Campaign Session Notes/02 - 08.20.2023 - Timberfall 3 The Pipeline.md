### Loop the Third Part 2
- Mechanic's pockets: 
	- A sandwich that's not moldy 
		- "Have fun at work daddy <3"
		- I take the sandwich and eat it
	- A wallet
		- Weird looking coins haven't seen before
		- "Authorization of work and passage"
			- The bearer of this Card is Authorized to perform activities related to or consisting of the maintenance and continued operation of the **Eternal Rose Project**, as granted by the authority and benevolence of The Mage.
	- Tools of unknown types
	- Notepad: 
		- Operational Inspection 3 
		- Energy levels normal 
		- Pressure gauges normal (buncha numbers)
		- Pipeline in unknown condition. Identified one area with potentially compromised structural integrity, almost resembling stretch marks. Further inspection needed.
	- ID Card (seems fake)
		- Currently: have a holographic portrait
		- Here it's just a regular painting, the layout is all off, fields you would expect
		- Thornton Desmond Jr. (it's a weird name)
		- Race: "Non-elf"
		- Birthday: 117 years ago but he looks 40 years old
- Where the pipe ends, there's a 20 feet of pipe that seems pretty stretched, at the end of the pipe it looks like someone pulled it apart
- The tree is bright crimson red
- I walk back towards the tree on the pipe
	- Pipe & tree connected smooth-ish
	- Drilled into the tree
	- I'm now under the tree
- On your right: see very strange looking forest, looks corrupted, all the trees are slightly the wrong shape (uncanny valley but tree) and wrong color 
- Past the forest I see a frozen creek
	- Part between forest / creek and pipe is barren, some stumps, there's basically nothing, machine cleared
- Fence between me being on pipe and connection to tree
	- Entrance to 13th sector prohibited to nearly anyone*
- Walk towards edge of creek through forest
	- Air is hella cold
	- It's much quieter here than anywhere else, elsewhere there's a passive background noise of crickets / birds etc.
	- Here there is no life, **dead** silent
	- You notice several areas here with piles of animal corpses, there's a tree under which there are 5 squirrels, recently deceased, another area with birds
		- Dunno how they died, there aren't any noticeable injuries on them
		- Their eyes are open
- I stab a tree
	- where I hit it it just crumbles, very flimsy
- I stab a squirrel corpse
	- a little bit of red lightning goes towards the tree, no flash
- I chop a tree down
	- One spark of red flies towards the tree
- The stumps are "normal" just machine cleared
- Walk towards the edge of the island sort of on the outside of the forest
- Can see next sector
	- See dilapidated buildings, another slums area similar to last one I saw
	- There's a shitty looking fence between creek and slums
	- This area is relatively less policed
- The creek has been chopped off
	- 3 cm at the very very very edge which seem a little more melted than the rest
	- There's some dead fish frozen in
- The Slums 2
	- Walk up to fence
	- 11:45 am
	- I hear wailing, a distressed sounding crowd, source of distress unknown
	- They are on the other side of slums (but still in the slums just closer to the fence)
- I hop the fence
- A group of roughly 20 ppl in ragged clothes, they are tied up and all tied together in a line and being escorted at sword / wand point by a bajillion guards towards the tree
	- I hear a bunch of distressed sounds, "we haven't done anything" "please let us go"
	- I climb a building to try to see where the ppl are going
	- See a few ppl are being ushered through the barrier to the 13th sector
	- A very ominous shrieking noise emits from the tree, the tree is shrieking
- I jump along buildings towards tree
	- I land somewhat okay
	- Kartoshka rolls a nat 1 on stealth and a loud thud lands on the roof
- 1 guard hears over the shrieking and begins sprinting towards the building
- Kartoshka uses Shape Water to blind him with water
	- I drop on the guard to slam him into the ground and knife around his neck
	- I hear some thunderous footsteps coming towards me
- Kartoshka rolls off the roof, grabs me, dimension doors me across the slums (Kartoshka gets a nat 20 let's go)
	- Standard, root + wall above it
- I am now closer to the procession, recognize a few ppl from the crowd at the execution
	- The tree is wailing and the light being emitted from the tree is glowing less intensely
	- Group of exclusively poor ppl from the slums
- I will dash towards the tree, rolled initiative
	- Groups: 
		- 1: 1 guard ambushed + 2: 1 guard running towards him
		- 3, 4: 2 guards running towards him 
		- 7, 8: 2 guards at back of procession
		- 5, 6: 2 guards at front of procession
- Roughly 11:55
### Wee we are Running Combat
- 1 and 2 run and get up
- I ethereal step towards the procession and Kartoshka runs towards the edge of the island
	- He's out of render distance cause I can only see 60 ft. outwards
- 7 and 8: GO GO OR YOU DIE NOW
	- Shove ppl, some ppl fall and they are getting dragged
- 5 and 6: Begin grabbing people and just pulling them
- 3 and 4: Keep running
- 1 and 2: Out of my render distance
- I keep running
- 7 and 8: Someone who fell got his arm chopped off and stabbed him, and see black and white lightning go towards the tree
- 5 and 6: They keep dragging
- 3 and 4: Out
- 1 and 2: Out of render
- I end up literally right on the other side of the fence
	- A little further, a tunnel going straight underneath the tree (can't see into it)
	- I do see a guard moving into the tunnel, he's escorting a group of ppl
	- There are no guards on my side of the fence but there's literally guards on the other side
	- I ready action to scorching ray him with the nail polish if he seems me *and* does smth about it
- I walk into the tunnel and Hide
	- The entrance is well lit, and the tunnel opens up into an area with the walls covered in roots which are glowing a dim red (same color as tree)
	- Not man-made tunnel, but network of roots
	- It stops becoming dim as I walk in
- Ppl in procession ahead of me are being dragged along, nothing is happening to them yet
### Walking thru Tunnel
- I keep walking 30 ft. behind procession
- I hear footsteps towards the tunnel from behind me, the second procession is entering
- I see that there are now tunnels branching out, I continue walking towards core
- Guards at front of procession from behind me spot me, so I start running towards the center
- The tunnel I'm going through is not 10 ft. wide, I disengage and keep running
- I bind 2 guards on the left (one at the back and front of procession), and I dash past them (-6 hp from blood curse)
- I see an Atrium, on the ground, on one side, there is a pile of cow and sheep and animal corpses, they've been messily butchered
- On the left side I see the same thing except it's humans
- The roots on the walls are glowing more brightly
- Center: There's literally just one guard with an absolutely monstrously bloodied sword (this is the bloodiest of a sword you've ever seen)
- Haven't reached center, above me is a super thick root with some moss hanging off of it
- Through the atrium, I see a pipe and a very bright crimson light
- Guard runs towards me, attacks, -10 hp, as he slices, I feel a distinct shock as the blade passes through you, I see the blood on the sword emitting small little zaps of red lightning and take -1 dmg
- I bind him and keep dashing (-8 dmg from blood curse)
- I make it halfway into the tunnel which takes me almost right under the tree
- The walls have a gradient of brightness growing brighter
- The roots become more chaotic and violent, some of them are spiky, others are twisted in nonstandard ways, the terrain becomes difficult, vines hanging down, thorns everywhere
- The other guy runs towards me, is 10 ft away
- I keep dashing, -8 dmg from opportunity attack (60/92 hp)
- Reached central area
- On one side I see the massive pipe on the left ish curving directly upwards and going straight up, covered in vines and roots curling around it as if they're trying to get in
- Other roots going straight up the tree
- Tree is covered in brightly radiating foliage, crimson red
- In the center, I see a wood elf with bright red hair, The Mage, he is strung up by both his arms, his arms are **in** the roots, his hair is pulsing in sync with the walls
- As he sees you, the walls begin shaking
- Neutral to psychic damage, weak to fire damage, resistant to necrotic and lightning damage, neutral to acid, depending on circumstances may or may not be weak to radiant damage

### Combat with The Mage
- I start flame rite and deal damage
- "You know not what you temper with, you will cause your death and all of ours, do not disturb the rose"
	- I am impaled on all sides by roots
	- Siphon life force from me
	- Everything in room pulses bright red
- I scorching ray him, 17 dmg
- He screeches, and the tree screeches with him
	- Voice emits from within him and from the tree
- "You fool, your contribution will be appreciated"
- The roots below me throw me up into the ceiling where there are thorns
- Now I'm falling, I grab him and I'm hanging off of him
	- I feel an imminent feeling of devastation, I feel like I'm running out of time
	- Both of us are feeling this
	- The tree's bright red pulses which was previously once every 6 seconds and is now once p/second
- All of the walls instead of pulsing red they emit a blinding flash of white light, and now I'm at 30 hp
- He seems less tattered then he was a second ago
- I attempt to cut off his arm
	- 12 damage 
	- His arm is now hanging off, chopped about halfway through, very grotesque
- All of a sudden, my life force is being drained, he is in agony, as this happens, both take -12 necrotic damage
- That's his turn
- I slice through his wrist, his arm flops down, the root forcibly spit out the hand, I see a small amount of lightning going into the root, -14 damage
	- His hand was slightly charred
- Andrew rolled another initiative
- It is now the root 1 (with the hand shaped hole's) turn
	- It slithers downwards and attempts to grab my hand
	- "Nah too slow get juked"
	- The root 1 fails
- The Mage: attempts to get roots to pierce me, but half the roots don't move, he pierces himself as he pierces me, we both take 8 dmg 
- My turn: returned to 18 hp, The mage's hand has grown back but it's not in the tree root thingy
	- I make it halfway through his other wrist by slashing it -10 dmg
- The Root 1: attempts to grab the elf's other hand
	- I jam my weapon into the hand shaped hole of the root
	- The metal of my blade becomes instantly electrocuted, I feel a very faint vision of the clock, currently says 11:59.12
	- Feel the tree's hunger
	- Feel the tree is dying, it can't keep going, it needs energy now
- The Mage: uses his free hand to grab me to try to get me to let go of him
	- I am now sliding down
- My turn: Slice through his wrist, other root spits out his hand, he falls, I am still holding onto sword in root, will begin falling at start of next turn
	- 15 dmg
- The Root (one with sword in it) 1: Swings me towards the other root, I hold on
- The root 2: Frantically tries to grab my hand, I dodge it
- The Mage: breaks off one of the branches on the ground and slam it on the ground and use it as a staff, he dimension doors onto me and is now on my back
- 11:59.24
- The mage's other hand grows back
- My Turn: I fall on my back, and the mage is below me, as I'm getting up, I see the roots are menacingly approaching me, I curse of binding him and run away towards the pipe 
- The Roots: simultaneously attempt to grab both my hands, I dodge
- The Mage: gets up, a little staggered, takes his staff and snaps it over his knee, creates a ball of lightning in the center of where he snapped it, and kamehameha's it towards me, it hits the pipe but makes the roots larger but also hole larger
- 11:59.30
- The walls begin doing a massive shake, I hang on to the pipe as the walls begin shaking me off, I hear the clock begin striking (so the 12th strike is when it hits 12)
	- Too chaotic for any actions
	- Your time is up
	- The eternal rose is 
	- Deafening crash as branch falls off the rose
	- Lightning shooting everywhere
	- The tree is violent, hungry, and dying
	- The rose catches fire at 12
