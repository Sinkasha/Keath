# 03 - 09.12.2023 - Timberfall 4: The Plan
### Last Session
- Time loop 3 ended, where the tree died, we found the mage, and figured some stuff out
## [[Silvanus Encyclopedia/Ke'ath Mainland Silvanus#Timberfall\|Timberfall]]

- Awaken, not at the entrance of Timberfall, in a strange looking forest
- Where every tree is a young version of the eternal rose
- Do not feel alive *yet*
- Look down and see a ghostly shadow
- Right next to me is standing Kartoshka
	- Also ghostly
- Mystical forest
- The small trees are illuminating towards tree
- Floating towards it
- Touch it, feels underwhelming, it's missing smth
- K: how long did u survive
	- He survived 5 minutes after I left him
- The tree is meant for a happy dystopia where nobody dies
- "Pipeline"
- The pipe was supplying energy, but now it's broken so it isn't supplying energy to the tree
- I see that the trees in the forest are fluctuating in height, waving up and down, and one tree that's growing
- I see several crimson lightning fruit (fruit made of lightning) on the branch
- I touch it, and it feels more satisfying
- I eat it
### Loop #4
- K. runs and barrels thru the sector to get to Nessa, reaches thru the bars to Nessa and dimension doors her out
- We end up in pasture after I climb the fence and shit
- There are guards
- I signal to K. to kill the guard 5 ft in front of him who's not noticing him in a bush
- I slit his throat, cut his vocal cords, didn't kill him
- K. and Nessa murders him
- We buries the bodies
- We do self introductions and shit
- Nessa has been dying for weeks
- We exchange information, go thru tunnel of pasture to get to center of tree, goal: kill the mage cause tree is causing time loop so if tree die loop dies
- Go thru the tunnel
- Lack of guards cause of timing
- Make it to slaughter room, less bodies, bodies that are here are a day old
- Keep going towards central atrium
- I feel watched
- One crimson rite, fire and radiant on each weapon
- I walk in and I'm immediately impaled
- "Don't stop me it's for the best of everyone"
	- "Don't interfere"
	- Loop 
	- Going thru a loop costs energy as well
	- Surprised I'm alive
	- Surprised we're all alive
	- Buying time for ppl to try to figure something out
- What happens if the tree dies
	- The city falls
	- Frozen in time, so the land used to be high up and then time passed and now it's floating
- We're a portable black hole, light comes in and it doesn't leave, and it drives the time loop 
- The Mage: I'm pretty sure the barrier drops right before we time loop, so that's why it flashes once an hour and why signal gets out once an hour
- Nessa: What if we try falling, if the whole island plummets, and then reset right above the ground
- I defeated the universe. It had disadvantage. I was impaled. 
- So if we reset time to half a second before we land we nullify velocity
