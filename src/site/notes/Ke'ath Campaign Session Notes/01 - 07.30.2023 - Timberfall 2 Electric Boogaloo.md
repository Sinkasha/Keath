### Loop the Second
- Everyone in the town is wearing a rose lapel 
- Just a little outside of the city, walled city
- Nessa's signal is being sent out every hour
	- Bird radar died 
- In a truncated pizza slice of the town with the entrance, jail, guillotine, city hall, guard center, bar, goes straight towards the tree
	- Behind city hall, guard station barrier in the truncated pizza slice area 
	- Tree behind the guard center
	- Guillotine in front of city hall
	- Every pizza slice is divided from other pizza slices, but heavily guarded
	- Looks hastily constructed
	- Most of the buildings were hastily constructed on top of foundations which existed for other buildings
	- Houses on top look flimsy, boards and shit, the foundation is rock solid
- Other pizza slices do not have entrances to the outside of Timberfall
- 11:01am
- Mammoth Catman make drunk, drag him into the bar
	- The bar is *completely* empty, the shelves have nothing on them, there is no alcohol served here in millennia
	- The countertops are clean, no dust
	- No people no drinks no bitches 
	- MAMCAT: "Now wait a minute you said the drinks gonna be here but there are no drinks"
	- "Why would we need drinks" "We don't need food" "That's what the mage said" "Everyone knows the mage, the cool guy gonna save us from everything" "There are no problems"
- There's a trapdoor for a wine cellar
	- It's clean but there's no wine
- 11:03 am
	- Hear cheers outside
- I drag MAMCAT outside towards the city center
- The crowd is very excited
- MAMCAT looks at you, "we're gonna be executing the traitor"
	- "The traitor is some weirdo who said the rose is not real"
	- "Finalizing her approval of death"
- I keep dragging him towards the center, draw more stares, cause no one recognizes me or Kartoshka
	- Outer edges of the crowd don't care too much
- Kartoshka fireballs the guillotine
	- Blasts the guillotine to smithereens
		- Even more hastily constructed than everything else
	- 2 to 3 rows of people vaporized, blinding flash from the people who died to fireball
	- nat 20, eyes adjust to the light, see little wisps of crackling red lightning going from where they used to stand and go into the tree
##### Combat 1
1. Guard Jefffffrej: looks beaten up, turn towards the crowd, and sees us (with a slanted MAMCAT), runs up and is in front of us
   Runs towards us and misses first attack, then hits with 2nd (-22 hp, 70/92)
2. Guard Thuoqnπ: "Jeff where you at?" Jeff: "I'm over here! I hit them once don't worry I have it under control"
   Thuoqnπ goes in the opposite direction, towards the smoldering remains of the guillotine and slices his sword
3. Silvanus: Crimson rite lightning damage, I slash guard Jefffffrej with Requiem, the lightning is red (it is not usually, why?)
   Guard_Nessa that was dragging Nessa and Nessa is blinded af, Nessa is 20 ft. from me
4. MAMCAT: "There's a fun party" Tried to gaslight him into saying he had cast fireball, it did not work even tho he hella drunk
   He runs away, 15ft away
On the top of one of the walls of the pizza slice, I see a wood elf with bright red hair, very spiky, he is wearing a long robe with ornamental rose designs (same as ppl in town) on it with gold borders, jumps down and gracefully glides down, and without asking any questions, looking at the scene, instantly snaps his fingers, snaps fingers, shoots crimson red lightning at me ouchie, -22hp (43/92), but Jefffffrej is now also severely beaten up
The wood elf is completely silent, not even to cast the spell
11:04am
5. Guard Tghammäce: Meanders to Thuoqnπ but ends up meandering towards us, slashes sword and hits nothing and then hits me (-15, 28/92)
6. The Crowd: collectively not blind, booking it towards the entrance, several guards further back towards the entrance who seem to be getting into position to stop the crowd from leaving the town
7. Kartoshka: run towards Nessa and cast Gaseous Form, Jefffffrej misses opportunity attack, runs towards city hall, the guards by the entrance to left pizza slice exit is collectively sprinting towards the scene of the crime, in the other pizza slice, there is one or two stragglers of ordinary civilians who were not here at the execution poking their heads in to this pizza slice from the other pizza slice to try to see what's going on 
   The entrance is like a ramp going up onto the root, in the wall there is a small little doorway which is open because the guards from the other side started running in
   The door is flimsy af
8. Guard Jefffffrej: attacks me, nat 20 (-16hp, 12/92 hp), second attack but hits, (-25 hp, I am unconscious weeeee)
9. Guard Thuoqnπ: runs towards Kartoshka
10. Silvanus: 1 failure
11. The Mage: massive spikes come out from the roots, converge inwards on K., and how's he stuck there
12. Guard Tghammäce: runs towards Kartoshka
13. The Crowd: they overwhelm the guards trying to stop them at the entrance, running out the gate
14. Kartoshka: Dimension door into the other slice where he sees the ppl poking their heads through
    Seem completely empty, not a lot of people, the people he do see is hella beat up, other than that, looks like a residential district, tons of nice looking houses, there's a nice little sign above it that says "Res-Sect 2", there are 4 clocks so every slice can see the clock
    Run to the door opposite that and stick his head through the door
    Seems like barracks
    Seems like there should be 12 sectors
    The guard that was previously guarding truncated section of Res-Sect 2 is running towards K. and hits K. and he dies
### Loop The Third
- It is now 11am
- Long rested 
- K: "I don't think that was the plan y'know"
- In the gates stands MAMCAT, and the crowd, and guards
- Dimension Door into Res-Sect 1 which is on the other side of Entrance Sect (see [[Timberfall Map.png]])
	- Onto roof of a house
	- Carbon copy of res sect 2
- Lasso the wall
- Levitate me, [[Minor Illusion\|Minor Illusion]] me as a wisp of smoke, make it to the wall unseen, against all odds lol
- Kartoshka goes across same way I do
- The guards see the wisp of smoke, Kartoshka [[Minor Illusion\|Minor Illusion]] an explosion and the guards are distracted 
- It's 11:07am
- See one guard on each entrance between each passageway between the slices
- Walk to other wall, Mold Earth to make a tunnel to the next sector over
	- Pasture , ominous looking tunnel past the truncated end, 3 guards (more than usual) and they are guarding a tunnel
	- Specifically constructed to avoid the tree
- Dimension door into tunnel past the guards, and fail -14 hp (78/92), cheers coming from main sector
- When Nessa presumably dies, tree pulsates
- 11:10am
- Mold earth to next sector over, discover The Slums
	- Seems contradictory, actual building look more competently constructed then res-sect ones, but they are also very dilapidated, look almost abandoned but ppl live in these, properly connected to foundation unlike other houses 
	- See group of 4 guards systematically combing through every building, checking for people
	- We sit around and wait, the guards found someone in tattered clothing, dragging them out of the house, "It was ordered by the mage that you must be at the execution, the execution is already over what are you doing here"
		- Person mildly protesting, very tattered, "Listen, I don't understand what's the point, wasn't the entire point of this is that there's no death why are we killing people"
		- Guard shuts him up
		- Drag him out of the building, behind it, and then you see a flash of light (oop he ded)
		- See as red lightning goes towards the tree, the tree pulsates 
- We stealthily go around the slum, avoiding the guards
- Mold Earth to the next sector, the dirt slides down, there is a slope straight down into a chasm from a cliff, root by chasm goes down into the chasm
	- Throw a rock down chasm
	- Can't hear as it goes down
	- No truncated end
	- Can walk towards tree, so we do that
- 11:20am
- Walk towards tree
- 11:25am
	- Look down into chasm, it's pitch black, it's exact same utter darkness that surrounded the city before we entered
	- Wall from Slums to chasm by truncated end, well built compared to others
- Reached inner portion, can see one sector past chasm, see pipe with a lot of dials and stuff on it instead of a root
- Go into pipe sector where pipe goes *into* the tree, navigate along pipe, see dials and they are all at 0 (measuring dials)
	- Walls stopped construction at the chasm, so no wall just edge of island
	- Edge of pipe on the edge, the pipe is broken off can't see where the rest of it is, next to the pipe, hanging off the edge of island, on my side, I see the body of the upper half of a mechanic, part of back bone hanging off of island, rest of the body went who knows where
	- On the island, it seems like he died a day ago, on the side not on the island, it's the most ancient skeleton I've seen 
	- He's wearing a rose lapel as well and ordinary mechanic clothes, human, male
	- Dunno how he died
	- Look through pockets, find a wrench (?)
