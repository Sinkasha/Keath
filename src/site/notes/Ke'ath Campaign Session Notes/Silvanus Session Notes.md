![Morrigan Dying Monologue.png|500](/img/user/Morrigan%20Dying%20Monologue.png)

## In the Astral Plane
![Thanatos Cutscene Monologue.png|700](/img/user/Thanatos%20Cutscene%20Monologue.png)
- Thanatos in room destroyed by magic (vision to player)
	- Young w/gray hair, black eyes, cool cloak, scythe similar to headless man
	- (who?) missing 2 limbs, charred, "foolish practice to do magic during a double eclipse"
	- Has a leather book with names of death, severs soul and body
	- Sees "Sephai" and "Morrigan" in the book, "the souls pain to track down" (will be?)
	- Eagle distracts him, misses Sephai entering the portal
	- Follows Morrigan, but loses track of Morrigan
	- Gambles and goes to the astral plane
- Sephai's soul floats, Thanatos crosses his name out
- The line beneath Sephai has no name
- He also causes the death of cup-summoning god Chashka (since his only believer Morrigan has died)

- In the same moment as the vision ends, Morrigan floats with no LoS to Thanatos, neither saw the Headless Man
- See white plane
- Thanatos performed banishing rite on cup-summoning God
	- Chashka yeets away from Thanatos
	- Create semi-circle around Chashka, who's frantically summoning cups and yeeting them

- The "Astral Sea" has denser atmosphere

- Kartoshka, we need 30ft. Up, cicadas, “yes”, separate chunk of cicadas float up slowly
	- cicadas: “help” “get backup”

- we’re right outside the city
- talking with K.

	- runic script, black, starry points
![Mysterious Script from Mining Town.png|700](/img/user/Mysterious%20Script%20from%20Mining%20Town.png)
- it says, after I decoded it:
`This place is a message... And part of a system of messages... Pay attention to it! Sending this message was important to us. We considered ourselves to be a powerful culture. This place is not a place of honor... No highly esteemed deed is commemorated here... Nothing valued is here. What is here was dangerous and repulsive to us. This message is a warning about danger. The danger is in a particular location... It increases towards a center... The center of danger is here... Of a particular size and shape, and below us. The danger is still present, in your time, as it was in ours. The danger is to the body, and it can kill. The form of the danger is an emanation of energy. The danger is unleashed only if you substantially disturb this place physically. This place is best shunned and left uninhabited. `
- I leave after taking dmg, when I return, K. and X. are still sound asleep, my nail polish is glowing very brightly and my rations are spoiled
- K. Wakes up at 8am, wants to leave, Xoisa is dead asleep
- tried to tickle him, failed
- K. Uses mold earth, `/\/\/\` like a massage to wake him up
- X. Finally rolls up, awake, “didn’t dream for the first time in 100 years”, who typically dreams of electric sheep
- now fly away, K. asks about plaque, I tell him I went to see it, he’s like, r u stupid, I shrug, I show him, he doesn’t know the language
	- but now, K. says, we know exactly what a city did before vanishing
	- it was also exporting more energy than Briesville needs
	- A. Find info on [[Silvanus Encyclopedia/Ke'ath Mainland Silvanus#Ke'ath Mining Co.\|KMC]] (ke’ath mining company)
	- B. Lead on other disappeared cities
- can’t believe such a cute kid killed the king (how/why did convo get here?) (I presume they mean Sephai)

## Back in Katal
- arrive at Katal at 3pm
- Xoisa will be back in a week, at midnight, at silver forest

- Now distorted, all colors wrong
	- Pink toads, neon green trees, ground is green/red
	- Center of swamp, purple radiation from underwater, single tree beside this point
	- Tattered red banner, no text
- Close eyes, open again, Colors more saturated
- Walk towards thing, feel feet, sink, but eye level not, this is a vision
	- Keep going for 15 min. but no progress
- I close my eyes and walk forwards, then open eyes, colors more vibrant, made it to the water, coming from underwater cavern, I jump in, try swim downwards, then do it with eyes closed
	- See glow through eyelids, H2O gets warmer, eventually find pocket of air, not short of breath tho
- Glow coming from crystal in black obsidian room-sized box
- 2 monstrous hags swimming by the box
- Make myself ghostly, float towards box, hags don't see me, I enter, open eyes
- See crystal, tetrahedron, purple, I touch it, see thru different eye, the swamp from above, there's a red trail of wispy smoke, the path I followed, faint red glow coming from smth (nearby village)?
- I cut myself on it, notice no blood comes out, the tetrahedron pulses brightly, hags unaware
- The red smoke trail vanished
- Appear immediately at little underwater bubble/cave
- See walls lined with bodies, on racks, corpses, any race, any gender, see lots of sailors and merchants
- Lots of bodies, placed methodically, seems to be being preserved, see a 3rd hag, kneeling at center of cave, see Houseplants, then disappear (how tf do I see Houseplants?)
- The hag is receiving instructions, mentally, her mouth is moving, but no sound
- Go examine bodies, they don't have faces, they're blurry
- I can move around cave w/eyes open
	- Anything having personal ID is gone
- I stab them, they don't bleed, the wound gets blurred/mixed/blended
- She jolts upward, as if awake, the racks are almost completely full, 3 spots missing
- I sneak/pretend to be dead body, the smell is amplified
- Hag leaves, follow her, to cube, I am a boulder chilling
	- Hag: "Almost done, few left, then it's over, he will set us free"
- TP into cube, next turn into hammer, fall on crystal, it cracks

- They hammer the crystal, try to stick the prong bit into crack, they turn into net made of chains, settle on me, constrained
- I turn into electric eel, shock em, hear the chain scream, I bonk the ceiling
- Hag is eel, zoom towards me, arc of electricity into crystal, they pulse but don't transform
- I swim above them, turn into boulder, fall down, smush them, kill em
- Crystal is not pulsing at all, completely dark, hear distorted speech, only the tone, confused and angy
- I touch, hear "Where did you go? What happened"
	- I ask "who are you, who the hell r u"
- No glow from crystal, head towards direction of initial glow, dreary eyes, until I jolt awake
##### Back in Institute
- Andrea above me, in tube, out for 5 hours
	- The houseplants can speak in sentences now apparently woo
- Tell Andrea

- I blind orc's glasses w/tinkering and ethereal step towards K.
- K. is hit, loses concentration, Nessa appears, who runs
- K. poison sprays, hits
- K. is mobbed by ppl
- I spin outta ethereal step, boost fire wall but forget entire last minute
	- Big headache, forget mob, where Nessa is
	- I believe this is a Memorium side effect

- Nessa: Unknown
- K: levitates, takes a bit of a hit
- Crowd: unknown
- Guard 2:

- I am between mob
- K. is dying
- Crowd:

- Mobs me
- Am bound, surrender, 
- Cast spare the dying on K after convincing them
