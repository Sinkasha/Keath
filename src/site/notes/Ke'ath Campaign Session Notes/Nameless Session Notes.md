## The Beginning

In the corner of the Whistling Wolf tavern, deep in the shadows, her face covered by a hood, sits [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/The Nameless\|The Nameless]]. Behind her rests a tragic history, with little hope for the future. Outside on the doorstep to the tavern, a package rests, inconspicuously. 
For reasons unknown, the tavern bursts into flames. Rats stream out from within the tavern. Rowdy customers cooked rat skewers by the fire, while she watched from the shadows. It was time for her to leave. As she approached her boat, a man ran up to her, [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/Feradonus Nameless\|Feradonus]]. He implored her to travel to the mainland and inform the king of the rat plague. After all, the [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Miscellaneous Nameless#Harvest Festival\|Harvest Festival]] was approaching, and it would not do to have a rat plague during the Festival. She agreed, as she was the only person with a boat, and into the distance, she sailed.

## [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/Sephai\|Sephai]]

Due to the lack of naval [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Miscellaneous Nameless#Maps\|maps]], [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/The Nameless\|The Nameless]] can only travel in one direction and hope for the best. On her way to what she hopes to be the mainland, she finds [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/Sephai\|Sephai]], a young tiefling, afloat in the sea. She pulls him onto the ship and examines him. He appears to be a cleric, carrying a holy book of [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath Religions of the World Nameless#Apollo\|Apollo]], and comes from a slave ship, as indicated by the manacle marks on his wrist. When [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/Sephai\|Sephai]] awakes, he informs her that he must go to the mainland, and thus they decide to journey together. 

## Alluring Island

[[Hooded Conversations#2 -  After package is delivered, Alluring Island\|Hooded]]

With amazing luck, the first island that [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/The Nameless\|The Nameless]] and the [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/Sephai\|Sephai]] encounter is the [[Nameless Encyclopedia/The Islands Nameless#Alluring Island\|Alluring Island]], a cursed island. All the travelers who visit this island are forced to the center of the island, and most are never seen again.
They were greeted by a man calling himself [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/Zephanoth Nameless\|Zephanoth]], a priest of [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath Religions of the World Nameless#Poseidon\|Poseidon]]. He explained the curse, wishing them luck as their legs forced them towards the center of the island. 
[[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/The Nameless\|The Nameless]] and [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/Sephai\|Sephai]] journeyed into the center of the island, where in a swamp, they found 3 witches. During the intense battle, [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/The Nameless\|The Nameless]], heeding the advice of [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/The Hooded Nameless\|The Hooded]], separated the witches by taunting them, and eventually, [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/The Nameless\|The Nameless]] and [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/Sephai\|Sephai]] successfully killed the 3 witches.  
Because the two were exhausted, they set up camp and fell asleep right beside the swamp. However, in the middle of the night, [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/The Nameless\|The Nameless]] crept up, and ran all the way back to the town. Once there, she located the church where Zephanoth stayed, crept into his room through a window, and after making him unconscious by smothering his face with a pillow, stole his magical item, a necklace. She then planted it on one of the witches, with [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/Sephai\|Sephai]] none the wiser to her midnight escapade. 
In the morning, when the two awaken and examine the witch’s bodies, they find the magical item. The two bring this evidence with them back to the village, where Zephanoth along with two guards immediately started pointing fingers at [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/The Nameless\|The Nameless]], stating that she had come in the middle of the night to steal his necklace. 
This was, even though true, quite an outrageous proposal, as who in their right mind would leave their team member alone in the middle of the night, asleep? Much less run several hours back to the town. Of course, [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/The Nameless\|The Nameless]] capitalized upon this far- fetchedness but it was no use. The guards insisted that [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/The Nameless\|The Nameless]] be taken in for questioning. However, [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/The Nameless\|The Nameless]] must have run out of patience, for she pulled a knife and stabbed the priest right next to her square in the heart, and then turned and ran, grabbing [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/Sephai\|Sephai]] who was sitting dazedly on the side. 
As [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/The Nameless\|The Nameless]] nimbly dodged the various obstacles, [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/Sephai\|Sephai]] followed behind her, much more clumsily. [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/The Nameless\|The Nameless]] made it to the boat first, cutting the lines mooring it to the shore. Poor [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/Sephai\|Sephai]] took a leap of faith into the boat, almost missing, and bringing with them a single guard, who was quickly dispatched. And thus the two sailed away from the island in uproar.

## After Alluring Island

On their way to the mainland, [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/The Nameless\|The Nameless]] and [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/Sephai\|Sephai]] ran into [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/The Battlehammer Family Nameless\|the Battlehammer Family]], who sailed up to them in a fancy yacht, complete with its own minibar and cabin. [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/Sephai\|Sephai]] was very jealous of the decked out ship. The Battlehammers informed the two that they would be going to the mainland, to ensure that information of the rat plague reached the king. 
After a particularly long time sailing, much longer than what would be expected, the two encounter a pack of dolphins and whales frantically swimming towards them, injured, their blood trailing in the water. But it is too late to turn back, or to go anywhere now, as their supplies are dwindling. [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/Sephai\|Sephai]] is unsure if there is or if there isn’t magic. The two continue to follow the faint trail of blood in the water, leading them towards a dead killer whale, cleanly sliced down the middle beside a massive abandoned cargo ship. This ship was anchored in what seemed to be the middle of nowhere, it was beaten up, its sails were torn, the hull damaged, the wood rotten. Very specifically, there is a part of the sail that is chopped cleanly off, much like the dead whale. 
In desperate need of supplies, [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/The Nameless\|The Nameless]] and [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/Sephai\|Sephai]] decide to board the ship. On the ship, as the two explore the rooms within, the two hear a strange skitter that almost echoes in a space that otherwise should not echo. In the first room, the two are attacked by phase spiders, as the two have all but stridden in with no sense of stealth. In the second room, after the stealthy opening of several wood crates and finding only rotten apples and whatnot, phase spiders start to show up, taking shelter and eating from a sack of grain in the corner. The spiders notice [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/The Nameless\|The Nameless]] and [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/Sephai\|Sephai]] and thus another fight commences. [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/Sephai\|Sephai]] comes out with a few injuries, but successfully heals himself. From there, the two step towards the engine room. 
The engine room started out looking quite normal, your typical engine room. However, in the corner, there was a plane of shimmery air, air that was different. On their side of the ground, the floor was moving, yet on the other side of the plane, the ground was not, having a hazy look to it, as if it was out of focus. On a whim, [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/The Nameless\|The Nameless]] lit a match and tossed it through the portal. The match burned normally, but still out of focus. Outside of the ship, the wind howled and the ship lurched. The plane remained static even though the boat did not. Another wave hits, and [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/The Nameless\|The Nameless]] hides within the plane. Yet when the next wave hit, she couldn’t comprehend the reality before her, and blacked out. 

[[Hooded Conversations#3 -  During the ship fainting incident\|Hooded]] 

## [[Nameless Encyclopedia/The Islands Nameless#Tropical Island\|Tropical Island]]

[[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/The Nameless\|The Nameless]] awakens in the bright sun, finding herself lying on a boulder. Her backpack is missing and her shortbow is damaged beyond use. [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/Sephai\|Sephai]]’s location is unknown. [[Nameless Encyclopedia/Ke'ath People Nameless/The Nameless\|The Nameless]] examines her surroundings, and finds that she is at the bottom of a cliff on a tropical island, one that is warm and pleasant. She climbs up the cliff and discovers that the island seems almost friendly, and that it is dusk.

--> religion on Apollo: sun healing, said to be the god from whom oracles divine their power, more structured following
Oracles are spread over the nation, those who claim divination powers, prophecies, etc. many make pilgrimages them to seek advice
--> religion on Poseidon: more laid back, less formal following (thus cults, not organized religion to prominent followers) no centralized church, loose and light

--> “Mmkay, what about your most chaotic potion?” “Oh? An adventurer”
--> lead to room with bowls, bottles, floating potions, etc., on shelves, 
--> grabs potion locked to table, is constantly swirling with colors, never one color/consistency
Wild Magic -  “hear of magic wild sorcerers?” These sorcerers are the most chaotic spellcasters, almost no control over magic, anything that comes out is what comes out, like the roll of a dice”
- With this potion, with every sip, no clue what will happen, there are 10 portions, please please never take more than 1 portion, we’ll be scraping you off the walls then 
Distant boom and cursing

--> when something is forgotten by everything, it comes here
- I take psychic damage and die
- i see the doll appear before me, and then it disintegrates, and a shadow seeps out among the sea of shadows and greets me, it looks more material, headless, it’s head is brutally chopped off, he has a skeleton hand, he turns and says
“I see you have a soul to trade. Choose your own soul or another soul.”
- I choose another soul
“Then it is a deal. Hold out your hand.”
- shadows from my arm coalesce into a white orb, blood drips from my middle finger and sizzles upon hitting the black disc, wisps float up, soundless boom thing?
“So it is done.”
- I feel awoken, I am standing on the disc at half hp
- portal behind me, silvery and ripply, miles away in the portal i can see a bright white vertical plane, then disappears
- opposite end of the disc are control panels with switches and buttons
button with 2 keyholes “shut off map alarm”
Levers for darkness, lockdown internal, lockdown external
Lever for emergency planar siphon shutoff
Training Console
Buttons for levitation, low gravity, high velocity, extreme weather, temperature, psychic warfare, holographic combat sim, planar shift (warning: experienced personnel only), other
- i flip the 2 switches for lockdown

Steve's knowledge -  psychic warfare is to train vs. psychic damage

- some shades barely manage to get snagged on the disc and begin to move towards me, as they move towards me, a pulse of energy (similar to the one that happened when i was brought back from the dead) emanates from me, the shades are thrown back, everything happens in dead silence
- go back through the portal, c5 sound ding
- there is still a wailing alarm, but there is no longer a “lockdown in effect” voice
Hooded: “above you”
Look up, hawk with halfling riding it above me, female, face heavily scarred, looking around in confusion cause can’t see through darkness
- grab max’s goggles, chuck them at halfling, who catches them, i am on barrack roof, she lands next to me, grabs my arm and says “better be worth the trouble, 27”
- then we do a bajillion plane shifts, bouncing between planes of fire, shadows, void, etc.
--> we are moving directionally as well, parallel to material plane, arrive in a dark, musty, gray stone room, the two of us collapse, I am no longer invis or disguised
- Long rest
- Awaken in bed, door, elven man "I believe he wanted to talk to you"
	- Stone corridor, unknown language on tapestry, rooms, large hall
	- Ornate door, cherry, inside stands The Hooded, censored head
	- Snatches map, tosses, reprimands me "I told you to be discreet"
	- "Dismissed"

	- Me: "Why are you here?"
	- "All of us stand to gain something"
	- Me: "A life"
	- Man: "I wish you luck" "This is the syndicate, we're all here to get smth, from him, all have own nickname, the Cloaked"
	- "Lots of politics, cape, hood, robed"
	- "27 of us, promised us smth we need, we're doing his tasks"
	- "Unknown goals, not supposed to talk to any of us"
	- Me: \*nod*
	- Man: "You're quiet, not talkative"
	- Me: "where's the exit"
	- Man: "I'll escort u"
- Guides past rooms, doors, dark, non-wooden, not metal, glass, ornate carving
	- Reach exit, is door, open door, feel headache, hear Hooded say "return to me"
	- Thru door, Hooded not as angry, but peeved
	- H: "The damage is already done, one more task"
	- "Kill the king"
	- Me: "why"
	- H: "Useful on your side, strange request, bring the tiefling"  (note: family > king?)
	- Me: "Will he be in danger?"
	- H: "No"
	- Me: "right"
	- H: "you're dismissed"
