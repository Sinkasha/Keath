-  Nessa: Are you still there?
	- "We're doin great"
	- "Good luck"

	- Sole witnesses to his atrocities, so wants us to die
- Kartoshka: stick hand into tree, see island pulse in out of existence
- Me: I stick hand into tree, tree simultaneously wants you out and also wants your lifeblood

- It's chaos
- Find MAMCAT: for the first time in decades i wanna drink
	- Wait I want to drink?
	- Looks at tree and goes "oh shit"
	- The rose is wilted
- Landed on a forest
- Nessa asks how we got here: fire breathing potions and stuff
- Nessa is a mermaid, has boots that create portable water to swim in 
- Sees balloon flying above you 
- Andrea: I FOUND YOU GUYS OH MY GOD
- She lowers a ladder
	- What happened to Nessa?
	- Nessa: I saw this island in the sky, I arrive, I see a hole in the ground, in the air there's a pitch black island, except once every hour it flashes, and I decide to go in and what could go wrong and bam I'm stuck
	- Explain what happened to Andrea
- Return to Katal
- Andrea: We've successfully investigated 2 of the 3 major disappearing cities
	- The third one is not even a city, it's paradoxically a..
	- This information is not for anybody, we'd all be executed
	- Unlocks a safe in a safe in a box with a ritual and whatnot 
	- 45 steps later, she pulls out an ancient looking map
	- See bizarre, see one specific square which has been bleached out by a person, very faintly see the words "Military Base" very faintly
	- Weird square in the ocean, feel like I've been to this place before (this or last life? I dunno)
	- This seems to be what we're dealing with, there was or still is a Ke'ath military base in this location 
	- Even figuring out this is a disappeared town was hard because by necessity we don't know about this
	- Don't ask how we found it
	- K. grimaces
	- The last of the major disappearances we need to investigate
